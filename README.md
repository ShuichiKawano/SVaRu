# Smoothing varying regularization.
This is an R source code for performing smoothing varying regularization (SVaRu). The directory *R* includes many files that perform SVaRu. Among them, most important file is given as follows.
- **SVaRu.R** provides SVaRu with the values of tuning parameters selected by generalized information criterion. 

SVaRu is introduced in the paper:
